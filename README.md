# smog-Dec8

If you are new here, please refer to the wiki page. There will be more instructions. 

For all students trying to find the resources, click on the pull-down menu that has the caption: "Branch: **master**", and choose the grade of your class. There will be multiple files to choose from. Find the file you need there. 

PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE MASTER BRANCH. THANK YOU.

#Copied from the wiki home page: 

This repository is a place for teachers to post files and links that will link to the various resources that will be used in the coming days. I will also build up a repository on Baidu Cloud. I will download all the resources here and upload them there for your convenience. But this will not be timely since I have my own work to do, too. Thanks for understanding.

If there are any important issues(such as resources that needs VPN to be downloaded, but you don't have one, and you request me to upload that to Baidu Cloud), please contact me via email at michaelmao99@126.com, or you can add my wechat with the wechat name "michaelmao99".
